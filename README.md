# Cloud Native Compound Knowledge Graph (CNCKG)
The Cloud Native Compound Knowledge Graph (CNCKG) aims to provide a comprehensive, accurate, and easily accessible drug information resource to support research, clinical practice, and decision making in the pharmaceutical field. Compound Knowledge Graph (CKG) is a structured drug knowledge base that organizes and represents compound properties, interactions, pathways, dosages, safety and other information in the form of a graph, enabling users to better understand and utilize this information.
With high scalability, flexibility and accessibility, CNCKG can take advantage of cloud computing and other advantages to realize the storage, processing and sharing of large-scale data, providing timely and accurate drug information to a wide range of medical practitioners and researchers, and promoting the development and innovation of the pharmaceutical field.
